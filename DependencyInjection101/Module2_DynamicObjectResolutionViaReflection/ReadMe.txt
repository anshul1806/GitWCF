In module 2 named we are going to use Resolvers, 
we will show how do we pass the object types to dynamically resolve dependencies
objects at runtime , create their instances and call the methods./
To run the module just set the module as startup project and run it.


We have also started using ShopperClassLib so that we have required classes available
in all our sub-sequent projects

Start looking into program.cs to see what changed from previous version to this.


To see the precursor, check the first project named as  Dependency101
