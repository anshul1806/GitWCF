This project sets the basic work for the other 
dependency work. For ex. It only shows how the dependency is 
injected via constructors.

In module 2 named type Resolvers, we will show how do we pass the 
object types to dynamically resolved dependency
objects at runtime , create their instances and call the methods./
To run the module just set the module as startup project and run it.
